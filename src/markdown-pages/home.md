A Software Engineer has experience in developing websites and servers. I learned to program primarily self-taught but I also graduated from a code boot camp, from the learning journey I learn how to solve problems with the right paradigm and critical thinking, and in developing new technology or application I need an aptitude to learn and adapt which I believe I have.
